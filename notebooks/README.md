This Python script provides a thorough analysis and visualization of solar energy data from three different locations: Benin, Sierra Leone, and Togo. The script performs a comprehensive set of tasks to assess the quality and characteristics of the data, including calculating summary statistics, detecting missing values, identifying outliers, and analyzing the presence of negative values.

The script also includes specific analyses for wind speed and temperature data, which are crucial factors in solar energy assessments. It creates joint plots to visualize the relationships between wind speed and wind gust, as well as ambient temperature and module A temperature. This comprehensive data analysis and visualization script can be a valuable tool for solar energy researchers and practitioners, as it provides insights that can inform decision-making processes and support the development of more accurate solar energy assessments and forecasts.
